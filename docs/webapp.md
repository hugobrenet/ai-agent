# OpenID client headers

The [integration guide](integration.md) tells how an interface speaks to the
agent with AG-UI, the protocol the turns of this guide are to be replaced
with.


Each protected HTTPS request under `/v1/om3` supplies the user's access token
and cluster ID, and may name a daemon node:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <OpenID access_token>
X-OpenSVC-Cluster-ID: <cluster.config.id>
X-OpenSVC-Node: <daemon.nodename>
```

`X-OpenSVC-Node` is optional and om3-only. Requests under `/v1/oc3` send only
`Authorization`, and no other header. Use the headers of the backend for each
of its routes: conversation creation, listing, reading, renaming, deletion,
turns and confirmations. The routes are listed in the
[client API](api.md#routes). The request bodies and SSE
events are unchanged: a turn still sends only `{"prompt":"..."}`. The target
belongs in the header so authentication completes before reading the body.
Use the current token after renewal; the agent does not refresh tokens.

Each target header is one exact, nonempty value of at most 256 bytes, without
surrounding whitespace, control characters or commas. Duplicate headers are
rejected. The cluster ID is required; the node, when present, narrows the
target. The MCP resolves the target in its administrator-owned catalogue,
never a client-supplied URL or DNS lookup. Missing or unknown targets are
refused without fallback.
Only OpenID Connect access tokens are accepted: a token issued by the daemon
itself, after a local sign-in, is refused.

## Verification and forwarding

The MCP checks structure, required `iss/sub/aud/exp`, optional `nbf`, a
nonempty `kid`, and asymmetric algorithms RS256/384/512, PS256/384/512 or
ES256/384/512.

The agent treats the token as opaque and forwards the exact Bearer and target
headers to its configured MCP's `GET /mcp/auth/whoami` over the MCP's local
Unix socket. The MCP verifies the token signature, with the issuer and
audience configured in the MCP, before relaying it to the target daemon, which
confirms the identity and enforces grants. The om3 MCP then returns:

```json
{
  "cluster_id": "<requested cluster ID>",
  "issuer": "<JWT iss>",
  "subject": "<JWT sub>",
  "expires_at": "<JWT exp as RFC3339>"
}
```

The oc3 MCP returns the same fields without `cluster_id`, after the collector
confirms the identity. The agent validates this bounded JSON response: complete
identity fields, a future expiry and, for om3, the requested cluster ID. It does not decode the JWT or
compare claims locally. The returned subject remains the opaque OpenID `sub`,
not `preferred_username`. MCP credential refusals, expired identities or a
requested-cluster mismatch return 401; unavailable verification or malformed
bridge responses return 503. No conversation or model access is
allowed before this check. The agent caches a whoami answer at most one
minute, never past its expiry, and a refusal five seconds. Conversation
ownership is backend + issuer + subject, plus the cluster ID for om3; oc3
conversations have no cluster. Each subsequent MCP request carries the same
Bearer and targets from private request context over MCP's local Unix socket;
none is exposed to the model or stored as a credential. Origin binding applies to all headers.
The returned expiry bounds the protected operation. Authentication itself
uses a short timeout, without locally reading the token's expiry.

## Conversation messages

`GET /v1/om3/conversations/{id}/messages` returns persisted user/assistant display
text from completed turns only. Supply the same Bearer and target headers as
other conversation operations. Every read verifies identity again; access is
bound to the conversation owner. Missing and foreign IDs both return 404;
owned expired conversations return 410. Successful responses use
`Cache-Control: no-store`.

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "id": "turn-id:1",
      "turn_id": "turn-id",
      "role": "user",
      "text": "Assess cluster health",
      "created_at": "2026-10-05T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "next_cursor": "1:1"
}
```

The initial page contains the latest messages, ordered chronologically within
that page. `limit` defaults to 50 and accepts 1 through 100. To load older
messages, pass the returned opaque cursor as `before` and prepend the resulting
page. An empty `next_cursor` means there are no older messages. Message IDs
remain stable across reads and restarts; pagination is exclusive and does not
shift when a new turn completes. Unknown, duplicate or invalid query parameters
return 400.

Pages are also bounded to 1 MiB of encoded JSON and may contain fewer than
`limit` messages. A single message that cannot fit is not truncated: the API
returns 413 with code `history_message_too_large`. An empty conversation returns
`{"messages":[],"next_cursor":""}`.

Only persisted text is projected. Empty assistant tool-call messages, tool
arguments/results, system prompts and provider credentials/state are excluded.
Tool activity and token usage are not returned in this V1. User timestamps use
the turn start time; assistant timestamps use its completion time, not the exact
time of each streaming chunk. Failed/canceled/interrupted turns do not persist
their prompt or partial answer, and therefore cannot be reconstructed here.

Reading does not invoke the model or tools, update retention, or change the
model context. All retained display messages can be paged, independently of
the smaller context window selected for model turns. Existing stored turns are
readable without a schema change. Metadata routes and SSE remain unchanged.

## Feedback

Under each assistant answer, offer 👍 and 👎. After a 👎, offer the optional
reasons and a free text field "What did you expect?", then send them with
`PUT /v1/om3/conversations/{id}/turns/{turn_id}/feedback`, using the
`turn_id` of the message, or of the `completed` event for an answer just
streamed:

| Reason | Code |
|---|---|
| Does not answer my question | `not_answered` |
| Missing information | `missing_information` |
| Incorrect or outdated information | `incorrect_or_outdated` |
| Hard to understand | `hard_to_understand` |
| Expected action not done | `action_not_done` |

`feedback` on the assistant messages of a page restores the choice after a
reload; `DELETE` on the same path withdraws it. Tell the user that their
feedback and the exchange it rates are kept to improve the assistant, without
their identity. See [the API](api.md#feedback) for the limits.

## Action confirmation

A tool that changes the cluster and that MCP annotates `destructiveHint: true`
never runs on the model's request alone: the user confirms or rejects it. A
tool that is not read-only and declares no `destructiveHint` is treated as
destructive, as the MCP specification defaults it. Read-only tools and
non-destructive actions run without confirmation.

### Request

When the model calls such a tool, the agent stores the turn in the
`awaiting_confirmation` state without running the call, then ends the turn
stream with:

```text
event: confirmation_required
data: {"type":"confirmation_required","iteration":1,"confirmation":{
  "id":"<confirmation ID>","turn_id":"<turn ID>",
  "tool":{"name":"stop_object","title":"Stop object","destructive":true},
  "arguments":{"path":"prod/svc/web"},
  "expires_at":"2026-10-09T17:45:00Z"}}
```

The stream then ends without `completed`. Show the tool, its title and its
exact arguments, which are the call that runs if the user approves: take them
from this event, not from the model text, which can describe the action
differently. The confirmation expires after 10 minutes.

`argument_types`, when present, gives the media type of text arguments, as
the input schema of the tool declares them in `contentMediaType`, such as
`{"yaml":"application/yaml"}` for the definition of a form: show such an
argument by its type, its lines and indentation kept, highlighted for a
type the client knows, rather than guess the format of a text. Show any
text holding line breaks with its whitespace kept, typed or not
(`white-space: pre-wrap`). The pending confirmation a conversation read
gives (`pending_confirmation`) carries it too.

### Decision

```http
POST /v1/om3/conversations/{id}/turns/{turn_id}/confirmation
Content-Type: application/json

{"confirmation_id":"<confirmation ID>","decision":"approve"}
```

`decision` is exactly `approve` or `reject`. Any other value, an unknown field
or a second object returns 400: a decision cannot change the arguments or add
text for the model. The identity is verified again and must own the
conversation. A confirmation is used once.

The response is a new turn stream. Approved, the stored call runs, then the
model continues; rejected, the model is told the action did not run, and
answers. The stream may end with another `confirmation_required` when the
model calls a further destructive tool.

| Case | Status | Code |
|---|---|---|
| Invalid body or decision | 400 | `invalid_request`, `invalid_decision` |
| Unknown or foreign conversation or turn | 404 | `conversation_not_found` |
| No such pending confirmation, or already decided | 409 | `confirmation_not_pending` |
| Confirmation expired | 410 | `confirmation_expired`; the turn failed and the call did not run |

### While it waits

- `GET /v1/om3/conversations/{id}` returns `pending_confirmation`, with the same
  fields as the event, while a confirmation waits: show it again after a page
  reload.
- A new turn returns 409 `conversation_busy` until the user decides or the
  confirmation expires; an expired one no longer blocks the conversation.
- A pending confirmation survives an agent restart.

## CORS

Set `OPENSVC_AI_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in the agent environment and restart:

```dotenv
# Restrictive: allow these webapp origins only.
OPENSVC_AI_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://webapp-a.example:1215,https://webapp-b.example:1215

# Alternatively: allow every browser origin.
OPENSVC_AI_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*
```

Empty or unset disables CORS. Origins contain the scheme, hostname and optional
port, without `/ui`, a trailing slash, credentials, query or fragment. HTTP
origins are accepted for local frontend development; the agent API still uses
HTTPS. Hostnames are normalized to lowercase and default ports are omitted.
Partial wildcards are not supported, and `*` cannot be mixed with a list.
Malformed configuration prevents startup, without echoing its contents.

The browser client must use `fetch` with `credentials: "omit"` and supply its
Bearer token explicitly. The agent never sets `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`.
Open mode permits use from any website; it does not relax JWT verification,
cluster/node catalogue restrictions, daemon grants or TLS checks. Use exact
origins when they are known and controlled.

Preflight `OPTIONS` requests are handled before JWT authentication. Allowed
methods are `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH` and `DELETE`; allowed request headers are
`Authorization`, `Content-Type`, `X-OpenSVC-Cluster-ID` and `X-OpenSVC-Node`.
Successful preflights return 204 and may be cached by the browser for 600
seconds. Actual requests still pass through normal authentication, and allowed
origins receive CORS headers on errors and SSE responses too. Unlisted origins
in restrictive mode return 403; invalid preflight methods/headers also return
403 without invoking authentication, conversation storage or the model.

Clients without `Origin` are unaffected. CORS is a browser
policy, not an authentication mechanism or protection against non-browser
clients. No CORS headers or origin registrations are sent to MCP or daemons.
